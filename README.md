# golox
golox is a Tree Walk interpreter written in Go.
### Why?
Well, interpreters are interesting. Maybe not tree walk interpreters themeselves (I implemented one for Shell a while back in C), but I'm looking at this as way to play around a bit with Go.
<br />
I'm reading [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), which implements it in Java - this prospect didn't exactly had me leaping from enthusiasm, hence Go.
I don't expect this little project to expose me to the most interesting Go features (gorountines, for instance), but anyways.
### Next steps
Once this is done the plan is to look more into bytecode interpreters, before eventually graduating to the big-boy league of Compilers.
